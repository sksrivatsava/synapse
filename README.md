Webinars have become increasingly important over the years, and numerous frameworks have
stood at the forefront of hosting and scheduling such events. However, the absence of a unified
social front for all of such event organizers and viewers has always been the cause of
inaccessibility and hindered outreach, since the number of platforms available to do this are
manifold.
This project, "Synapse" aims at bridging the gap between event organizers and viewers, by
constructing a unified end-to-end social interaction platform, which would eventually enable
webinar organizers and viewers across regions to register with the platform, and would deliver
real-time updates on webinars to viewers, using Clound MySql. It also employs the use of APIs to
directly schedule webinars and detailed viewership statistics and recommendation
customization to users. On the whole, the objective of this project is to develop a wholesome
social media platform for webinar viewers and organizers, similar to most video streaming
platforms.
